# Overview

This is a REST Express application featuring the NEXUS (NEXUS Unified System) - an advanced local AI ensemble platform with sophisticated multi-modal capabilities. The project implements a comprehensive self-learning ensemble intelligence system with React frontend, Express backend, PostgreSQL database, and extensive local AI/ML features including autonomous learning, curriculum-driven education, and human-in-the-loop collaboration. The architecture supports 100% local AI model integration with no external API dependencies, advanced safety systems, and ethical oversight.
