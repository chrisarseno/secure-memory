# Commercial Licensing — secure-memory

This project is dual-licensed:

- **AGPL-3.0** — Free for open-source use with copyleft obligations
- **Commercial License** — Proprietary use without AGPL requirements

## Tiers

| Feature | Community (Free) | Pro ($149/mo) | Enterprise ($499/mo) |
|---------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Base consciousness monitoring | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Knowledge graph visualization | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Advanced analytics | — | Yes | Yes |
| Autonomous learning | — | Yes | Yes |
| Distributed monitoring | — | — | Yes |
| Real-time collaboration | — | — | Yes |
| Support SLA | Community | 48h email | 4h priority |

## How It Works

- **No license key** — All code runs (AGPL mode). Source is visible per AGPL obligations.
- **License key set** — Only entitled features are unlocked. Blocked features show a clear error with upgrade instructions.
- **Server unreachable** — Fail-closed for gated features.
